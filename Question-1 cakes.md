Ram is a baker. During this quarantine time he has been trying to bake and teach his son mathematics. So to make things interesting he tried to integrate baking into maths.
He baked cakes with multiple layers. He bakes N number of cakes. Each cake has multiple layers and the number of layers on each case form a number (For eg : Ram bakes 3 cakes. First cake has 2 layers, next one has 3 and the last one has 5. So the sequence/number formed is 235)
Now he asked his son to calculate the sum of all the numbers that can be generated from the sequence that he earlier got.
Shyam is a little weak in math so you have to help him solve this problem.

Note : If the number of layers in 2 cakes are separate then you can assume them as distinct numbers and solve.
eg: 0 6 0 is the sequence, then the total sum of all the sequences will be 1332 as we consider 600 twice and 60 twice and 6 twice.
